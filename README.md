# Open Source BONEWORKS Mods

Some of the mods that I've made for BONEWORKS, some were never published to BoneTome but were just posted on Discord so if you've never heard of some of them, that's why.

If you want the source to another mod, open an issue or something and I'll probably add it.

If you are to redistribute a modified version of one of my mods, please refer to the [LICENSE](https://github.com/TrevTV/Boneworks-OpenSourceMods/blob/main/LICENSE).
